## 📱 Responsive Design

Desktop – full navigation header with photos & videos in view.
Tablet/Mobile – collapsible menu with toggle (menu icon).
Scroll Behavior – dropdown menu closes automatically when scrolling.

## 🎨 Key CSS Concepts Used

Flexbox for header and content alignment.
Clamp() for responsive font sizes.
Box-shadow to create depth (applied to vertical sides where needed).
Media queries (@media) to handle screens below 900px.

## 🔧 Future Improvements

Add image lightbox for gallery preview.
Add video modal popup instead of redirect.
Add animations (fade-in on scroll, carousel).
Integrate a contact form (with backend support).
